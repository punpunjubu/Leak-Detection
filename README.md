# Leak-Detection in Home (Water supply and Gas)

Using MQTT Protocol to communicate with many clients to a broker.

Detecting leaks in walls by using humidity sensors for key signs of water damage from pipes, and Detecting gas pipe line leaks by using Carbon Monoxide sensors.

In reality if we spot the water leak we will stop pumping system and close a gate valve.

Equipments

1. sensors

   -1 Ultrasonic sensor (for measuring the level of water)
   
   -1 or more rain drop sensors (for making sure there are water leaks)
   
   -2 or more Humidity sensors (for detecting humidity from the leak pipes)
   
   -2 Carbon Monoxide sensors (for detecting gas)
   
2. microcontroller

   -1 or more ESP8266
   
   -1 or more ESP32
